{"name":"RSH","body":"# RSH\r\n\r\n#### Install RSH right now!\r\n\r\nTo install RSH right now you just have to `gem install rsh`.\r\n\r\n#### What is RSH?\r\nRSH is a UNIX and SH compliant shell built in Ruby. It features all the traditional Shell commands (basically anything in the `$PATH`) and evaluating ruby code:\r\n\r\n- `eval puts \"some ruby code can be put here\"`\r\n\r\nThis is in alpha stage, it might contain bugs (it was built in a few hours :P)\r\n\r\n#### How do I start it?\r\n\r\nIt's simple, get on Terminal, `cd` to he directory and run `ruby s.rb`. Your terminal screen will clear and the RSH prompt will appear.\r\n\r\n#### How do I kill it?\r\n\r\nIf you didn't enabled debug mode just use `quit`. Else just use Ctrl-C.\r\n\r\nIf this doesn't works, open a new window and use `killall ruby`. That should kill it.\r\n\r\n#### More info\r\n\r\n- It doesn't needs any gems for now\r\n- It uses [Colorize](https://github.com/fazibear/colorize) by [fazibear](https://github.com/fazibear/) but slighty modified for bright (bold) letters.- \r\n- It has a little config file (`.rsh`) in the script directory. It contains the version and the state of debug mode. (Debug mode shows the command and the arguments on every enter and makes it so you can Ctrl-C and quit it.)\r\n- It has been only tested on:\r\n\t-  Mac OS X Lion 10.7.3 and Ruby 1.9.3-p125\r\n\t-  Fedora Core 16 and Ruby 1.9.3-p125\r\n\r\n![RSH](http://i.imgur.com/eRUcY.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### License\r\nrsh - RSH is a UNIX and SH compliant shell built in Ruby\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2012 Pablo Merino\r\n\r\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
